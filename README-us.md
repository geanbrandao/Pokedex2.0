## Features

This Pokedex app has two main screens:

### Pokemon List Screen

On the initial screen, a list of Pokemon is displayed, each represented by an image, its name, types, and number. Additionally, there is a button to favorite each Pokemon (favorite button is non-functional). When clicking on a Pokemon from the list, the user is redirected to the second screen.

### Pokemon Details Screen

On the second screen, detailed information about the selected Pokemon is displayed. In addition to the information from the first screen, the weight, height, generation, ability, gender ratio, and a list of Pokemon statistics are shown. Pokemon evolutions are also displayed.
